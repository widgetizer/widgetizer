# Ambitetris

Ambitetris is a unique dual-control Tetris variant built in Phaser. Control two tetrominoes simultaneously—one with each hand (or with a friend in co-op)! Features include:

- Classic Tetris gameplay, colors, and line clears
- Push and nudge mechanics: falling tetrominoes can push each other down or sideways
- Wall kicks for smooth rotations near walls and other blocks
- Distinct tile textures for left and right tetrominoes (aero-glass vs. bevel)
- "AmbiClear" detection: celebrate when both hands contribute to a line clear within a short window
- Animated row clears with flashing and falling blocks

### Controls (default)
- **Left Tetromino:** C (left), B (right), V (down), G (rotate)
- **Right Tetromino:** J (left), L (right), K (down), I (rotate)

You can play solo (ambidextrous!) or with a friend for chaotic co-op fun.

## Why Ambitetris?
Playing Ambitetris is a brain workout—like learning a new instrument! It challenges hand/eye coordination, multitasking, and timing. It might even be therapeutic for some players.
